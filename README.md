# Warehouse Operations Simulation

## Project Status - Milestone 2

### Implemented Features
- Poisson-based stochastic order arrivals
- (s, Q) inventory control policy
- Core entity classes (Order, InventoryBin)
- Basic metrics tracking
- Simulation execution loop

### In Progress
- Agent routing logic (Dijkstra)
- Packing station queue modeling
- Congestion modeling

### Planned Next Steps
- Implement graph-based routing
- Add queue-based packing station behavior
- Collect fulfillment time statistics
- Add visualization
